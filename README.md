Privacy Preserving Collaborative Encrypted Network Traffic Classification 
<br> 
Interconnecting the following works: Differential Privacy, Federated Learning, Membership Inference Attacks, Encrypted Traffic Classification

<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
## Differential Privacy
We make use of DPSGD to ensure a ceratin level of privacy.  
Ref:https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629

<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
## Federated Learning
The architecture for our Federated learning Setting. 
![Architecture](https://github.com/PrivPkt/PrivPkt/blob/master/privpkt.PNG)
We utilize Federated Averaging to enable the collaborative learning setting. 
Ref: https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629

<br> 
<br> 
## Membership Inference Attacks 
We make use of Shokri et al. Membership Inference Attacks to evaluate our mitigations. 
Ref: https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05820
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
## Encrypted Traffic Classification
We tackle the problem of Encrypted Traffic Classification. 
We utilize the work of DeepPacket and use the ISCX Vpn 2016 Dataset to evaluate our work.
