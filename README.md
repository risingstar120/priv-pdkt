Privacy Preserving Collaborative Encrypted Network Traffic Classification 
<br> 
Interconnecting the following works: Differential Privacy, Federated Learning, Membership Inference Attacks, Encrypted Traffic Classification

<br> 
<br> 
<h3>Differential Privacy</h3>
We make use of DPSGD to ensure a ceratin level of privacy.

<br> 
<h3>Federated Learning</h3>
The architecture for our Federated learning Setting.

We utilize Federated Averaging to enable the collaborative learning setting.

<br> 
<h3>Membership Inference Attacks </h3>
We make use of Shokri et al. Membership Inference Attacks to evaluate our mitigations.

<br> 
<h3> Encrypted Traffic Classification</h3>
We tackle the problem of Encrypted Traffic Classification. 
We utilize the work of DeepPacket and use the ISCX Vpn 2016 Dataset to evaluate our work.
