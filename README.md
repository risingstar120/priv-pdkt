Privacy Preserving Collaborative Encrypted Network Traffic Classification 
<br> 
Interconnecting the following works: 
*Differential Privacy
*Federated Learning
*Membership Inference Attacks
*Encrypted Traffic Classification
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
### The architecture for our Federated learning Setting

<br> 
We utilize Federated Averaging to enable the collaborative learning setting.

<br> 
### Differential Privacy
We make use of DPSGD to ensure a ceratin level of privacy.

<br> 
### Membership Inference Attacks 
We make use of Shokri et al. Membership Inference Attacks to evaluate our mitigations. 
<br>

<br> 
### Encrypted Traffic Classification
We tackle the problem of Encrypted Traffic Classification. 
<br> We utilize the work of DeepPacket and use the ISCX Vpn 2016 Dataset to evaluate our work.
